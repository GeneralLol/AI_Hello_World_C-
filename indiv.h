	//Methods
	//Constructors
	Indiv();						//Default constructor. Do nothing.
	Indiv(std::string tgtStr);		//Sets the target string to the input string, generates everything according.
	Indiv(std::fstream& saveFile); 	//Reads info from the save file. Save file setup handled by the main program.
	Indiv(Indiv& src1, Indiv& src2);	//Creates a cross between src1 and src2.
	//Mutators
	int mutate();				//mutate: mutates the current individual. Returns status numbers.
	int generate();				//generate: generates a sting to be evaluated. Used only in eval, but didn't want to bother making it private.
	int eval();					//eval: Evaluates and returns the fitness score. Changes fitness value.
	int end_generation(); 		//Decides whether to keep or discard the mutations.

	//Operators
	//void operator = (Indiv& tgt); //Using void here is because there is really no need to have it return anything in the usecase. Also don't want to create new objects when returning.
	bool operator < (Indiv& tgt); //Defines this operator so sort() can be used.
